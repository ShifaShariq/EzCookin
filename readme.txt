Our project uses a third party API from the forkify.api.hiroku app. to run Webpack application, you must first open the EZ cooking folder.
On your device's terminal. You will then have to enter the following command:


>> npm run start


The loading up will take time but as soon as it has loaded up, your browser should open at the localhost our website is hosted on.

Enjoy!
